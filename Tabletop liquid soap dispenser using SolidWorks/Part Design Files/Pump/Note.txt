Although we designed the pump, we did not 3D printed and used it in our final product due to shortage of time.
Assembly of pump is though and had a high chance of not working properly so we opted for a market small pump.
Due to approching submission deadline we decided not to take any risk. Help was taken from Youtube
during the designing of pump.
